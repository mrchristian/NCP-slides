## Config File - holds it all together {.smaller}

```yaml
# A Quarto project configuration file (_quarto.yml)  
project:
  type: book
book:
  title: "Book Title"
  author: "Author Name"
  date: "2026-02-13"
  doi: "10.1234/example.doi"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - data.qmd
    - notebook.ipynb
    - references.qmd
bibliography: references.bib
repositories:
  - name: "Online Book Repository"
    url: "https://gitlab.com/account/repo"
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
  epub:
    cover-image: cover.png
```

::: aside
The challenge is how to get all the part into the  [Quarto Book Config file](https://quarto.org/docs/books/#config-file). There will be further configation files as part of the project, but this Quarto example is as an illustration of the concept.
